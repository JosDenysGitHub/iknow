**iKnow** is a library for Natural Language Processing that identifies entities (phrases) and their semantic context in natural language text in English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Ukrainian, Czech and Japanese. It was originally developed by [i.Know](https://www.linkedin.com/company/i.know/about/) in Belgium, acquired by [InterSystems](https://www.intersystems.com) in 2010 to be embedded in its Cach√© and [IRIS Data Platform](http://www.intersystems.com/iris) products. InterSystems published the iKnow engine as open source in 2020.
